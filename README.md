This is a program written in Python 3.7.9 that simply experiments with the use of OOP concepts learned in class.

Basically, there is a "PhoneBundle" class that would hypothetically allow a user to choose phones after inputting the number of phones they wanted, along with their budget. After selecting their phones, they could then check if the purchase fell within their indicated budget, and get a discount for buying multiple phones at once through the bundle (the more phones a user bought, the higher the percentage discount).

Ideally, there would be an entire menu and selection system for all of this, but at this current time, they are just classes. Their concepts can be tested through instantiating example objects in the code.

That is currently the extent of this program.
